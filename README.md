## ProjetEZ

Agregated data are in the folder called "Agrege/Base". Here you can find subfolder from the several databases used (ECB, EUROSTAT, IMF, AWM, Datastream). The original database are in .csv in these subfolders. 

The .R file called "transformation" corresponds to the code used to modify the variables (log ..). 

The .pdf file called "database_description" gives an overview of the database and the transformations made. 

If you want to use the dataset of agregated data for the EZ that we used in our estimation, load the database called "vardata.Rdata" in the folder /Agrege/Base.
